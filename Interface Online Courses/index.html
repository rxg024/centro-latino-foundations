								For the Basics of Web Development course, no - this course will teach you everything you need to know.

							<dd>
								Maybe - kinda depends on you! The material is presented in a very step-by-step manner as it guides you

							<dd>
								Courses are open from the first of the month for 31 days, and each course is divided into about 8-10
